## Love coding and learning

Front end world is so huge and changing every minute. Therefore all the time I find something new to learn.
  

## Front-end developer

I'm a front-end developer with **11 years** of mixed **experience** in different web technologies. 
Now I am working mostly with React/NextJs, VueJs, NodeJs, Angular, and MongoDB.

## Hobbies
Except for the cool work I am doing there is a lot of stuff a love doing:
- Road cycling (on the way to increase my FTP) in northern Italy
- Mountain biking
- Skiing
- Reading poetry
  
## Projects

During my career, I developed different projects such as:  
-No-code drag&drop **website builder** with an automatic responsive layout and exporting options.  
-**Streaming web app** for teachers where teachers stream video or presentations and in parallel gather feedback via polls and comments.

-**Learning Progress app** is used by thousands of teachers across schools in Italy.

-**Digital signature** web app where businesses can create interactive documents and receive them signed by clients. The app is used by banks and insurance companies in Israel.

-**Social network for writers**. Where people share their fiction stories, and books. Like any social network, it has likes, comments, blogging, profile, writing tools, user reading statistics, etc.

-**Smart buildings** management software allows engineers to keep buildings safe for people as well as energy efficient.
  

In parallel to my main work, I'm working on a **pet project** which is a social network for fiction writers. The project was written from scratch with MEAN stack technologies. At the moment the project contains already **45k users**.
  

In my free time, I'm **writing tech articles** on topics such as JavaScript, Angular, frontend, and participating in tech creators group among the brightest minds in the FrontEnd industry such as GDEs, MVPs, Github stars. My recent articles clearly demonstrate the development skills and the approach I am using. At the moment preparing myself to tech talks on the topics of Accessibility and performance, because these topics are widely ignored by developers.
